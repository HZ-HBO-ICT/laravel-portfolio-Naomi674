        <h1>Who Am I</h1>
        <p>My name is Naomi Norris, and I am 19 years old. I graduated from a high school in an extremely small town in Southwest Michigan with a standard high school diploma. Because my high school was so small it didn’t offer very many classes, so when I finished taking all of the classes it offered I moved on to taking some classes at a local community college and a Tech Center. One of the classes I took during this time was a cyber security and computer networking class. Which I very much enjoyed, although it was cut short due to COVID so we only got to the hardware side of computers and didn’t get to any coding. One of my absolute favorite things to do in my free time is to go for runs or walks, I was even on my high school's cross country team! I also love doing different crafty things like knitting or doing puzzles. During the summers I worked at the busiest ice cream shop in all of Michigan where I was in charge of customer service. I absolutely loved this job. I got to meet people from all over the country and most of the time I got to be the best part of their day, because who doesn’t feel happier after eating ice cream.
